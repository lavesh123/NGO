      <h2 style="color: white; padding-top: 30px;">Sometimes when you are dealing with a serious problem you watch the world wandering happily by and want to either a) cry b) drown your sorrows c) say some rude words or d) all of the above, because it seems you are the only one in this sorry situation. Well, you are not. Although there will be ups and downs you will come out the other side.
        In 2006 Arjunuday was born as a sibling to a healthy sister Lavanya. Tulika and Rahul Verma  planned a second baby to give company to their daughter. It was a full term pregnancy without any complication.
        
        The minute Arjunuday was born, the doctors found multiple congenital defects that shattered the dreams of the parents. They were devastated and could not understand why they were being punished in this way. They had no choice but to accept the inevitable reality and decided to give him the best possible medical care.</h2>
